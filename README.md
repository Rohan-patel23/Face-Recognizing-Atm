# Face-Recognizing-ATM-Machine
This is new method of payment that has the potential to be safest payment method till date, because it uses biometric data and face recognition algorithms to validate payments.This method reduces the possibility of forgery and and duplication of account details and false payments.Whenever a user initiates a payment, he/she has to validate the payment, not by using an OTP or PIN, but with their face patterns.

Installaion:-
1)Install python 3.5 or above 
2)Install opencv 
3)Install pillow 
4)Install MongoDb 

How It Works:-
we have created a database In which each user is given a seprate UIN(Unique Identification Number) to which all the accounts belonging to the user is connected and also all the personal data is present.When a user want to use the atm he/she first need to scan there Face which is matched with there UIN if matched the user could withdraw or deposit money,see there account details and also be able to transfer money.
